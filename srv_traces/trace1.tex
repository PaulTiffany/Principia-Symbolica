\subsection*{1 Objective}
\label{subsection:trace1_objective}

Evaluate the symbolic robustness of drift regulation under perturbation by comparing Banach-space (L1) and Hilbert-space (L2) regression models in the presence of structured outliers. This trace probes the stability of symbolic manifolds subjected to localized drift shocks.

\subsection*{2 Validation Setup}
\label{subsection:trace1_validation_setup}

Synthetic data was generated based on the base function $y = \sin(x) + \text{noise}$, where Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\sigma = 0.22$ was added. Two high-magnitude outliers were injected at $x = -2$ and $x = +2$, shifted by $+2.5$ and $-2.5$ respectively. These perturbations simulate localized drift deviations.

Model Training:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L2 Model:} Trained via polynomial regression minimizing squared error (Hilbert norm sensitivity).
    \item \textbf{L1 Model:} Trained via polynomial regression minimizing absolute error (Banach norm resilience).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3 Symbolic Responses}
\label{subsection:trace1_symbolic_responses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L2 Residual Sum:} 13.91
    \item \textbf{L1 Residual Sum:} 12.06
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4 Observations}
\label{subsection:trace1_observations}

The L1 model achieved a lower total residual sum despite the injected perturbations. Visual inspection confirmed that the L2 regression curve was disproportionately distorted by the outliers, while the L1 fit remained closer to the underlying signal.

This shows that Banach symbolic spaces preserve coherence under symbolic drift perturbations better than Hilbert spaces, aligning with the predicted drift stability properties of reflective symbolic systems.

\subsection*{5 Conclusion}
\label{subsection:trace1_conclusion}

Symbolic resilience to localized drift emerges more strongly in Banach-structured representations. Symbolic coherence under perturbation favors L1 norms, reinforcing the structural assumptions underlying symbolic stability.

\subsection*{6 Theory Linkage}
\label{subsection:trace1_theory_linkage}

This SRV trace supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axiom II.2:} Drift Differentiates (Book II â€” De Stabilitate Driftus).
    \item \textbf{Theorem 2.2:} Second Law of Symbolic Thermodynamics (symbolic entropy grows unless countered by reflective regulation).
    \item \textbf{Symbolic Drift Stability Hypothesis:} Stable symbolic structures resist local drift shocks without catastrophic distortion.
\end{itemize}
