\subsection*{1 Objective}
\label{subsection:trace2_objective}

Investigate how symbolic entropy evolves under sparse feature corruption, comparing L1 (Banach) and L2 (Hilbert) regression models. This trace evaluates the resilience of symbolic structures when subjected to selective drift-induced perturbations.

\subsection*{2 Validation Setup}
\label{subsection:trace2_validation_setup}

Synthetic data was generated from a sparse linear signal embedded in Gaussian noise. Feature corruption was introduced by randomly selecting a small subset of features and injecting large-magnitude noise (shifted by $\pm 3.5$ units), simulating partial sensor or channel drift.

Model Training:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L2 Model:} Trained via squared error minimization, sensitive to outlier features.
    \item \textbf{L1 Model:} Trained via absolute error minimization, robust to sparse corruption.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3 Symbolic Responses}
\label{subsection:trace2_symbolic_responses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L2 Trace MAE:} 2.19
    \item \textbf{L1 Trace MAE:} 1.63
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4 Observations}
\label{subsection:trace2_observations}

The L1 model exhibited significantly lower mean absolute error on the corrupted trace set. Coefficient analysis showed that true signal features remained stable under L1 training, while L2 models reallocated weight onto corrupted dimensions.

This behavior indicates that Banach symbolic spaces preserve coherent mappings more effectively under targeted symbolic drift, minimizing entropy expansion.

\subsection*{5 Conclusion}
\label{subsection:trace2_conclusion}

Symbolic structures represented within Banach spaces maintain higher resilience to sparse drift perturbations. Sparse corruption induces symbolic entropy growth unless constrained by robust reflective stabilization mechanisms.

\subsection*{6 Theory Linkage}
\label{subsection:trace2_theory_linkage}

This SRV trace supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axiom II.2:} Drift Differentiates (Book II â€” De Stabilitate Driftus).
    \item \textbf{Theorem 2.2:} Second Law of Symbolic Thermodynamics (symbolic entropy increases unless stabilized).
    \item \textbf{Corollary 5.1:} Symbolic Life Criterion (positive free energy requires resilience under drift).
\end{itemize}
