\subsection*{1 Objective}
\label{subsection:trace3_objective}

Analyze the effect of drift perturbation on symbolic structures across a sweep of $L^p$ norms, to determine whether robustness evolves via discrete phase shifts or continuous probabilistic reweighting. This trace probes the reflective regulation of symbolic manifolds under increasing drift.

\subsection*{2 Validation Setup}
\label{subsection:trace3_validation_setup}

A polynomial regression task was performed on synthetic data with structured noise injection, mimicking gradual drift perturbations. Regression models were trained under $L^p$ norms for $p \in \{1.0, 1.2, \ldots, 2.0\}$. The objective was to observe how residual patterns, coefficient distributions, and symbolic coherence evolved with $p$.

Noise Model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structured drift perturbations introduced localized deviation from the true signal.
    \item Noise levels gradually increased to simulate realistic sensor degradation or environmental drift.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3 Symbolic Responses}
\label{subsection:trace3_symbolic_responses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Residuals varied smoothly across the $p$-sweep, without abrupt discontinuities.
    \item Coefficient magnitudes were reweighted gradually, showing probabilistic redistribution rather than sharp reset.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4 Observations}
\label{subsection:trace3_observations}

The absence of abrupt phase transitions suggests that symbolic robustness adapts through continuous reflective reweighting rather than discrete bifurcations. As $p$ increases, the symbolic structure probabilistically redistributes coherence weights, navigating the drift landscape while preserving symbolic viability.

\subsection*{5 Conclusion}
\label{subsection:trace3_conclusion}

Symbolic systems regulate drift perturbations via smooth reflective modulation across representational norms. Robustness to symbolic drift is not binary but arises through continuous rebalancing of symbolic free energy across emergent dimensionalities.

\subsection*{6 Theory Linkage}
\label{subsection:trace3_theory_linkage}

This SRV trace supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Theorem 2.2:} Second Law of Symbolic Thermodynamics (entropy growth under drift unless reflected).
    \item \textbf{Lemma 7.1:} Reflective Integration Lemma (reflection smooths drift fluctuations toward coherent identity).
    \item \textbf{Corollary 7.1:} Drift Collapse Equivalence (bounded drift collapse via reflective stabilization).
\end{itemize}
