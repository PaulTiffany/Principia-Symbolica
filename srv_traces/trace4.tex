\subsection*{1 Objective}
\label{subsection:trace4_objective}

Investigate how symbolic flow coherence evolves across varying $L^p$ norms in a high-dimensional setting, analyzing residual trends and coefficient sparsity. This trace probes the emergence of coherent symbolic structure under dimensional expansion.

\subsection*{2 Validation Setup}
\label{subsection:trace4_validation_setup}

Synthetic data was generated from a sparse linear signal in $d = 20$ dimensions. Regression models were trained across a sweep of $p \in \{1.0, 1.2, \ldots, 2.0\}$ norms, minimizing the $L^p$ loss function.

Metrics Recorded:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Residual Error:} Sum of absolute prediction deviations.
    \item \textbf{Sparsity:} Number of nonzero coefficients (thresholded by magnitude).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3 Symbolic Responses}
\label{subsection:trace4_symbolic_responses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Residual error increased gradually with $p$, flattening near $p = 1.8$.
    \item Coefficient sparsity decreased steadily as $p$ increased, indicating broader but less resilient symbolic support.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4 Observations}
\label{subsection:trace4_observations}

Lower $p$ norms (closer to L1) favored sparser, more resilient symbolic flows — concentrating coherence along narrow emergent structures. Higher $p$ norms diffused symbolic flow across broader but less robust dimensions, corresponding to increased symbolic entropy.

The transition from sparse to diffuse support was smooth, indicating a probabilistic symbolic drift rather than a sharp phase shift.

\subsection*{5 Conclusion}
\label{subsection:trace4_conclusion}

Symbolic flow coherence emerges through dimensional refinement under reflective drift regulation. Lower $p$ regimes consolidate symbolic structures into sparse, resilient flows, while higher $p$ regimes admit broader but more fragile symbolic expansions.

\subsection*{6 Theory Linkage}
\label{subsection:trace4_theory_linkage}

This SRV trace supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axiom II.6:} Parameterization under stabilized curvature (Book II — De Stabilitate Driftus).
    \item \textbf{Theorem 7.1:} Reflective Convergence to Stable Identity (reflective dynamics stabilize symbolic flows).
    \item \textbf{Corollary 7.3:} Stability-Innovation Equilibrium (balance between sparse innovation and reflective coherence).
\end{itemize}
